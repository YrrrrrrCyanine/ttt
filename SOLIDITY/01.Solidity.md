## Definition
▪ Solidity is a high-level language to write smart contracts for Ethereum.  
▪ Contracts can be defined as encapsulated units, similar to classes in   
traditional object-oriented programming languages like Java.  
▪ A contract has its own, persistent state on the blockchain which is  
defined by state variables in the contract.  
▪ Functions are used to change the state of the smart contract or to
perform other computations.
▪ Solidity is compiled to bytecode which is persistent and immutable once 
deployed to the blockchain:  
➔ No patch deployment possible  
➔ Smart contracts must be perfect before using them in production!
